My 3 partners and me finished our photo-sharing website!!! Our website is named "**phoTo**"! The link is [here](https://life-photo.herokuapp.com) (might need take sometime to load, be paticent:D).

**The inspiration behind our website**:
Nowadays, sharing photos has became a common habit among the youth. 
However, how to store and manage the big amount of data that users uploaded has became a problem for many social Apps. 
We found people usually do not care about their previous posts very much, and storing all those out-of-date data is a waste of resources. 
In addition,in many cases, users do not want others to be able to view their previous posts. 

Therefore, to help manage data, the main feature of our web is that **each post has a lifespan determined when creating**.
When a post reaches the end of its' lifespan, it will be removed automatically from the database, so no posts past lifespan can be viewed anywhere.
Additionally, to prevent ripoff, 'right click' is disabled to forbid saving images to local computers.
