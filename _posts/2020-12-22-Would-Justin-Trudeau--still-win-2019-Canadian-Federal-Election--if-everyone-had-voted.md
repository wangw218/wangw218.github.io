From an [article](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/07/06/if-everyone-had-voted-hillary-clinton-would-probably-be-president) in The Economist , if “everyone” had voted in 2016 US presidential election, Hillary Clinton would probably be president.

Based on the information on Statistics Canada, just over three-quarters [77%](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200226/dq200226b-eng.htm) of Canadians reported voting in the 2019 federal election, I was wondering whether or not Justin Trudeau still win the 2019 Canadian Federal Election if "everyone" had voted. I did this analysis using Multiple linear regression and the detailed analysis is [here](https://github.com/wangw218/STA304_FinalProject).

My final result is that Justin Trudeau would still win the 2019 Canadian federal election even if “everyone” had voted.
