title: "Study of Factors Affecting Ages of Having the First Child"

My teammates and me found age of having the first child has a positive correlation with the age of first marriage and family income using **Multiple Linear Regression** model.

Our data set was from General social survey on Family (cycle 31) but due to the privacy, I could not share this data. 

The detailed report can be found [here](https://github.com/wangw218/STA304PS2/blob/main/PS2/PS2_Final.Rmd).
